    <h1>This is the third view</h1>
    <p>This view is intended to demonstrate that views are actually simple to create and work with <br>
    and I also think that I need to polish up my touch-typing skills<br>
    I really hope this view works because I need to finish my project as soon as possible<br>
    I think I am also going to need to revisit html and css over the weekend as well as touch a litle bit on javascript<br>
    to horne my front end web development skills</p>
